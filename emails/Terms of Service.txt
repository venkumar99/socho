Terms of ServiceLast Updated Date: August 15, 2016Vchar3 provides an online service “CareVen” to help organize, store, and manage information related to your care or the care of your children, parents, and loved ones through our website, accessible at CareVen.com, or via applications for the iOS or Android operating systems (collectively, the “Site”). Please read carefully the following Terms of Service (“Terms”) and our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into these Terms. These Terms govern your access to and use of the CareVen apps and Collective Content (defined below) via the Site, and constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Vchar3.You acknowledge and agree that, by accessing or using the CareVen platforms, or by downloading, uploading, or posting any content from or on the Site or through the CareVen platforms, you are indicating that you have read, and that you understand and agree to be bound by, these Terms, whether or not you have registered via the Site. If you do not agree to these Terms, then you have no right to access or use the Site or CareVen platforms.NO MEDICAL ADVICEIF YOU ARE HAVING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, DIAL 911 IMMEDIATELY.We do not provide any medical or pharmaceutical advice. We are not health care providers. CareVen  are solely designed to support, not replace, the relationship that exists with any physician, pharmacist and other healthcare professionals. What we do is provide a way for you to take control and manage health care data. While we are not a covered entity under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), we take both the protection of your private health information and your ability to control and access such information very seriously, and will only use and disclose your information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.PROFILESWhen you register with us for access to the CareVen platforms and successfully complete the account registration process you will become a “Member” of the CareVen platform. As a Member, you will have the opportunity to create one or more care profiles (“Profiles”) and to add information, data, and images to your Profile(s) (“care data”). A Profile may relate to you or it may relate to your child, parent, or other person you are caring for. As a Member, you will have the opportunity to invite third-party caregivers (“Caregiver”) to access the “care data” that you create. If you elect to invite a Caregiver to access your “care data”, that Caregiver will receive an invitation to register with the CareVen platforms and will need to complete the account registration process to become a Member. In addition, any Caregiver that you invite to access your Profile(s) will have full access to all “Care Data”  within your Profile(s) as well as the ability to add, delete, distribute, download, and edit the same. Because of the sensitive and private nature of your health care and the health care of those loved ones on whose behalf you may be creating a Profile, we recommend that you protect the private and sensitive information contained within your Profile(s) and consider carefully whether to permit any Caregiver to access your “care data”. All Members are responsible for monitoring the Profile Content uploaded or added to their Profiles, whether uploaded by the Member, by a Caregiver, or by other third parties.If you are creating a profile on behalf of another person, by accepting these terms you attest that you are authorized by that person to create a profile on their behalf. To the extent you take action on behalf of the person you are caring for, you also attest that you have valid legal authority to take that action on their behalf.Please note that you, and not CareVen, are responsible for maintaining and protecting all “Care Data”. CareVen will not be liable to you for any loss or corruption of your “Care Data”, or for any costs or expenses associated with backing up or restoring any of your “Care Data”.CARE ADVISORSWe have a team of dedicated Care Advisors whose job is to support you in whatever way they can. By registering with us to access CareVen platforms, you agree that CareVen and CareVen’s Care Advisors may contact you to discuss CareVen’s services as well as third party services CareVen may make available to you in connection with your health and wellness. Third party services may include offering health insurance plans, including Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D health plan options that may be available through licensed insurance brokers, or other services that we may have the opportunity to offer from time to time. You agree that CareVen may contact you about CareVen platforms or third party services in various ways including, but not limited to, email, Inbox in the app, direct mail, telephone, cell phone, and SMS/text messages.MODIFICATIONCareVen reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, discontinue, or terminate the CareVen platforms or to modify these Terms, at any time and without prior notice.

By continuing to access or use the CareVen platforms after we have posted a modification on the Site or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms.
